Chrome Extension Ideas
- When the user opens a new tab, instead of the new tab page:
		-Open a hacker random news article with a minimum number of points

- click on the extension on any page to convert HTML into a playable level for some game?
		- e.g. pacman
		- maybe we color all divs one color, and all other elements another color
				- colors define walls, etc
				- some html elements could define special powerups

- make a webpage into darkmode

- capture something on webpage, make a post to slack automatically




---------------- aimlab game -------------
- class AimGame()
		- new AimGame()
		- properties on the game:
				- this.score
				- this.accuracy
				- this.transformations

		- methods on the game:
				- getAllElements()
				- assign unique z-index to each element on the page


- get a collection of all html elements on the page
- loop through elements
		- if element === button
				- if button has any elements in/on it
						- keep that on button
- "disarm" any existing onClicks, <a>, buttons
		- once we have a collection of all elements, remove any/all eventListeners from each element
- for each element, apply one random transformation from a list of possible transformations
		- element has:
				- update position = absolute
				- add an eventListener `addEventListener('click')`
				- a point value associated with its size

------ TO DO IF EXTRA TIME -------
- instead of deleting elements that fail the filter:
		- "disarm" them i.e. remove their href/type=submit/etc
